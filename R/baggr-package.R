#' baggr - a package for Bayesian meta-analysis
#'
#' This is _baggr_ (pronounced as _bagger_ or _badger_), a Bayesian meta-analysis package for R using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). _Baggr_ is intended to be user-friendly and transparent so that it's easier to understand the models you are building and criticise them. The current version is a stable prototype of a tool that's in active development so we are counting on your feedback.
#'
#' _Baggr_ provides a suite of Bayesian aggregation models for both summary statistics and full data sets to synthesise evidence collected from different groups, contexts or time periods.
