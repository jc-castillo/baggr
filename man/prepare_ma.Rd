\title{Convert from individual to summary data in meta-analyses}
\usage{
prepare_ma(data, standardise = NULL, log = FALSE, cfb = FALSE,
  summarise = TRUE, treatment = "treatment", baseline = NULL,
  group = "group", outcome = "outcome")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of individual-level observations
with columns \code{outcome} (numeric),
\code{treatment} (values 0 and 1) and
\code{group} (numeric, character or factor)}

\item{standardise}{logical; if TRUE, values of outcome
are standardised within each group}

\item{log}{logical; log-transform data?}

\item{cfb}{logical; calculate change from baseline?}

\item{summarise}{logical; convert to aggregate level data?}

\item{treatment}{name of column with treatment variable}

\item{baseline}{name of column with baseline variable}

\item{group}{name of the column with grouping variable}

\item{outcome}{name of column with outcome variable}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns \code{mu}, \code{se.mu},
\code{tau} and \code{se.tau}
}
\description{
Allows one-way conversion from full to summary data.
Input must be pre-formatted appropriately.
}
\details{
The conversions done by this function are not typically needed and may happen automatically
when data is fed to \link{baggr}. However, this function can be used to explicitly
convert from full to reduced (summarised) data without analysing it in any model.
It can be useful for examining your data.

If multiple operations are performed, they are taken in this order:
\enumerate{
\item conversion to log scale,
\item calculating change from baseline,
\item summarising data.
}
